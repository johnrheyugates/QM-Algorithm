# Quine-McCluskey Algorithm Implementation

## Introduction

The **Quine-McCluskey method**, or tabulation method, is a systematic technique for Boolean function minimization. It surpasses the Karnaugh map for functions with more than four variables, providing a structured approach to simplify complex Boolean expressions.

This implementation in Python extends the algorithm's capabilities to handle up to **26 variables**, offering flexibility and precision. The program is designed to guide users through inputting variables, specifying minterms, and incorporating "don't care" conditions, culminating in an optimized Boolean expression.

## Key Features

- **Decimal to Binary Conversion**: Efficiently converts decimal minterms to binary with zero-padding.
- **Prime Implicant Generation**: Iterative grouping of minterms to generate prime implicants.
- **Essential Prime Implicant Identification**: Builds and analyzes a prime implicant table for simplification.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simplifies input and output for easy interaction.
- **Accurate Results**: Outputs have been cross-verified with other implementations for correctness.
